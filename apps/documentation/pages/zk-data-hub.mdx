# Zero-Knowledge Data Hub

The Zero-Knowledge Data Hub provides access to historical onchain data to any other smart contract.

It does so by integrating historical onchain data from top DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Aave, Curve and others into a zero-knowledge proof data stream. Historical information like price, apy, and tvl become available to every future smart transaction

### How It Works

Every DeFi protocol saves high-value data on a public blockchain. 

*But that information is not always available in the future.*

For example the Uniswap V3 smart contracts store a have a limited number of slots for historical token pricing information. Which is the time-weighted average uses but why it can only reach so far back in time.

**ZK Data Hubs let users of travel through time on a blockchain.**

# High-Value Onchain Data Snapshots

Not all information is created equal. Some is more important.

District Labs's History Prover will identify the top DeFi protocols and regularly create history snapshots.

Automated Market Maker(AMM) protocols for prices.

Money Market protocols for Annual Percentage Yield (APY).

And more in the future.
