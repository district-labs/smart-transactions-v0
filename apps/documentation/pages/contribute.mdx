# Contribute

The District Finance protocol is Open Source and MIT licensed. And modular in nature.

We expect major contributions to occur around [Modules](/contribute/modules) and [Strategies](/contribute/strategies)

But everyone is welcome to contribute to the [Core](/contribute/core)


## Core

The core protocol handles how smart transactions are handled and executed. Including everything from how custom nonces are handled too how hook instructions are processed.
