# Intents

The [Smart Transaction](/how-it-works/smart-transactions) protocol is comprised of intent modules.

Intent module have to primary functions: read and write.

### Read
A intent module can be designed specifically to read onchain state.

For example the [BlockNumber Range](/intent-modules/block-number-range-intent) reads the current `blockNumber` and compares it to the constraints.

### Write
A intent module can be designed to execute specific onchain writes.

For example the [ERC20 Swap Spot Price](/intent-modules/-swap-spot-price) intent module requests a token swap for the current onchain spot price.

### Hybrid
An intent module can read and write if the logic requires it.

For example the [Finance Leverage Long](/intent-modules/aave-leverage-long) intent module reads important onchain data like a depositors `healthFactor` and requests requests both supplying and borrowing from the [Aave V3 Lending Pool](https://docs.aave.com/developers/getting-started/readme).

## Block Number Range Intent Module

#### Impact Analysis

The intent will allow users to define block number ranges when a smart transaction can be executed.

#### Requirements
No external requirements. The intent module reads data directly from an EVM blockchain.

#### Input Constraints
The Block Number Range intent module has 2 data instruction requirements:

1. StartBlock (uint64) - `startBlock`

The smart transaction must be executed on or after the `starBlock` instruction. 

2. EndBlock (uint64) - `endBlock`

The smart transaction must be executed on or before the `endBlock` instruction.

```solidity
function encode(
    uint64 startBlock,
    uint64 endBlock
)
    external
    pure
    returns (bytes memory data)
{
    data = abi.encodePacked(startBlock, endBlock);
}
```
