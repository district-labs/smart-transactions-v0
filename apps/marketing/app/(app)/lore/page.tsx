          worlds.

          Players can express complex trading intents. And other players can
          take the other side of the trade. All without the need for a
          centralized exchange or onchain order book.

        <h3 className="mt-6 text-2xl font-bold">Player vs Game</h3>
        <p className="">
          District Finance is unique because it allows players to interact with
          the game world in a more sophisticated way - while also reducing the
          complexity of the interaction.

          Players can create smart transaction that respond to the game world
          state.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          For example a player can create a smart transaction that is only valid
          if the price of ETH is above $2,500. Or if the average price of ETH
          over the last 30 days is below $2,500 using zero knowledge proofs.

        <p className="">The game world is built by block builders.</p>
        <p className="">
          Block builders execute smart transaction ands find optimal solutions
          to complex problems.
