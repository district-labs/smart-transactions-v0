Finding the best rates in DeFi is hard. There’s over 9,000 pools spread across nearly 400 protocols. If you’re like us, then you spend a lot of your days looking at different pools and aggregators trying to figure out where I should park my money until rates change and the next opportunity comes along.

And, let’s be real: who has time for that every single day? In reality, we leave our cash in unideal places, forget to check rates at that new incentivized pool, or fail to account for the gas fees that eat away at our profits.

We’ve felt this pain and thought, “There’s got to be a better way!”. So, we designed the Smart Cash strategy to solve it.

## Understanding District Smart Cash

Smart Cash is an investment strategy that automatically moves your stablecoins between pools with the highest APY. Investors can select the pools or tokens they want Smart Cash to analyze, and the strategy not only looks for the highest yield—but takes into consideration network and protocol fees, tax optimizations, and the sustainability of the yield.
